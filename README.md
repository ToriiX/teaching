# Teaching Database  

### I am working as a language teacher on the side. I created a database to store student information and teaching material such as teaching ideas and links. I use the database to store useful information, retrieve material for lessons and for creating student statistics. It is a simple database, but I wanted to show how SQL can be utilized regardless of the business size. The tables "student information", "learning", and  "study plan" can be joined by using the common key "student_id". I can look for suitable material according to student level in the "material" table. The level of each student when starting out is found in the table "student info". I have used the information in the database to create statistics and get an overview of the student base to improve my services.

### Insights:
Running analysis on the student info table, I learned the following that I can use to improve marketing strategies and student services:
- Around 35 percent of my students live in the country of the language, while 53 percent live or plan on moving there.
- Around 25 percent of my students are originally from Poland which is the country I have the most students from. 
- A total of 88 percent of my students start at A level (A0-A2), with around 30 percent without any prior knowledge of the language. 
- The gender distribution is around 50/50.
- Students at the B level tend to remain enrolled for the longest duration, whereas those without any prior knowledge exhibit the shortest retention period.
- Students at the highest level are learning the language for pleasure such as reading books and travelling, while most of the students without any prior knowledge are learning the language for travelling.
