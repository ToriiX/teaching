# Teaching Database  

### I am working as a language teacher on the side. I created a database to store student information and teaching material such as teaching ideas and links. I use the database to store useful information, retrieve material for lessons and for creating student statistics. It is a simple database, but I wanted to show how SQL can be utilized regardless of the business size. The tables "student information", "learning", and  "study plan" can be joined by using the common key "student_id". I can look for suitable material according to student level in the "material" table. The level of each student is found in the table "student information". I have used the information in the database to create statistics and get an overview of the student base to improving my services.
